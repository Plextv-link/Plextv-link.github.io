<p>Plex provides a way to easily access your entire digital library from any compatible computer, smartphone, or streaming device, without the need to transfer files manually. You can access media files stored on your Plex Media Server computer remotely over the internet via <b><a style="color:red;" href="https://plextv-link.github.io/">plex.tv/link</a></b> or let friends and family remotely view your movies, music, and pictures over the internet.</p>

<h2>What is Plex Activation Code?</h2>

<p>On your browser onto your desktop computer or mobile device, visit <b><a style="color:red;" href="https://plextv-link.github.io/">plex.tv/link</a></b> and make certain you’re signed to the proper Plex account. Input that the 4-character code and apply. Following the code is filed; your participant program will automatically refresh itself a few moments later and also be connected with your own account.</p>

<br>

<h2>Where to Connect to Your Account using a Link Code?</h2>
<br>

<p>Our big screen apps (such as Android TV, Apple TV, smart TVs, etc.) generally allow you to connect the app to your account by way of a 4-character link code. This allows you to connect to your account without having to laboriously enter login credentials via an on-screen keyboard or similar.</p>

<br>

<ol>
<li>The first thing you’ll generally see is an information screen, giving a little info about Plex and telling you where to sign up to create an account, if you don’t have one already. Assuming you do have an account, you can choose the Sign In button.</li>
<li>You’ll be presented with a 4-character code, which is what you’ll use to connect the app with your Plex account. On some platforms you can also scan a QR code with your smart phone/tablet camera app to take you to the correct web page.</li>
<li>In your browser on your desktop or mobile device, go to <b><a style="color:red;" href="https://plextv-link.github.io/">plex.tv/link</a></b> and ensure that you’re signed into the appropriate Plex account.</li>
<li>Enter the 4-character code and submit.</li>
<li>After the code is submitted, your player app will refresh itself a few seconds later and be linked with your account.</li>
</ol>
